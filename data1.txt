An LLM-based agent extends traditional LLMs by integrating external knowledge retrieval, task planning, and tool invocation, enabling structured decision-making in real-world applications Xi et\xa0al. LLM-based agents must process various data types, including clinical texts and medical images, and handle variability in medical terminology across different languages and cultures Li et\xa0al. Medical diagnosis systems powered by LLM agents currently receive limited feedback from patients and caregivers, despite the importance of including their perspectives in decision-making Kim et\xa0al. By continuously optimizing AI-generated diagnoses and treatment recommendations through iterative self-evolution, LLM-based agents can better integrate multimodal clinical data, including electronic health records, medical images, and laboratory findings Xu et\xa0al. Current medical LLM agents often use simulated hospitals for training, such as the Agent Hospital framework, which enables the autonomous evolution of doctor agents through synthetic patient interactions Li et\xa0al.', 'score': 0.99993026, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11301v1', 'title': 'Searching for Effective Medical Agent Architectures', 'content': 'This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for', 'score': 0.99989283, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16736', 'title': '[2504.16736] A Survey of AI Agent Protocols', 'content': '# Title:A Survey of AI Agent Protocols.

However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents. |  | (or  arXiv:2504.16736v3 [cs.AI] for this version) |.

Methods To address this gap to the deployment of agentic AI in healthcare, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. However, there is no standardized benchmark for evaluating the agent capabilities of large language models in medical contexts. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is needed to advance the role of large language models in healthcare from chatbots to sophisticated clinical agent systems (CAS). In conclusion, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad suite of medical-specific agent tasks, an interactive benchmarking environment, and a standardized evaluation framework that enables the systematic assessment and advancement of AI agents in medical settings.', 'score': 0.9998273, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://arxiv.org/html/2508.11957v1', 'title': 'A Comprehensive Review of AI Agents: Transforming ...', 'content': '1.
